# Final Project on Imitation Learning for CIS522
This repository holds the materials from our final project from Deep Learning for Data Science (CIS522) by Konrad Kording and Lyle Ungar at the University of Pennsylvania.

The "Code" folder holds the code for the models we trained: ridge regression, SAC, TD3, and behavioral cloning.

"Trained Agents" holds videos and gifs of the models after ~~insufficient~~ training.
