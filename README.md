# Final Project on Imitation Learning for CIS522
This repository holds the materials from our final project from Deep Learning for Data Science (CIS522) by Konrad Kording and Lyle Ungar at the University of Pennsylvania.

For our final project, we asked: can we leverage imitation learning to train an agent to learn human gait *better* and in a manner that is more *naturalistic* than those gaits learned by popular reinforcement learning (RL) agents?

The "Code" folder holds the code for the models we trained: ridge regression, SAC, TD3, and behavioral cloning.

"Trained Agents" holds videos and gifs of the models after ~~insufficient~~ training.

You can read our final report and examine the figures here as well.
